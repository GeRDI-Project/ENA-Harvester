# The ENA Harvester

This is a harvester for the [ENA Repository][6] build by Jan Fr√∂mberg ([jan.froemberg@tu-dresden.de](mailto:jan.froemberg@tu-dresden.de)).
This harvester was build on top of a [RESTful-Harvester Library][1] provided by the University of Kiel ([Robin Weiss](mailto:row@informatik.uni-kiel.de)).

## Prerequisites

[Docker][3] if you plan to build the harvester within a Docker-Image.
Otherwise you need a Java Application Server like [Glassfish][2], [Tomcat][5] or [Jetty][4]
There you have to deploy the created war-File.

## How to build?

You can easily build a docker image by using the terminal and typing:

    $ mvn clean verify -DdockerBuild

There is also a utility script for building and running a Jetty docker container via:

    $ mvn clean verify -DdockerRun

## How to run?

Base-URL: [http://localhost:8080/ena](http://localhost:8080/ena). 
You have two options for harvesting the ENA DB. Option 1 is by Accession-Number und Option 2 is by Taxonomy via a Taxon-Key like 10088.
